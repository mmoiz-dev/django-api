## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First Run**: Models will be downloaded on first use (may take 5-10 minutes)
2. **Processing Time**: Advanced endpoints take longer but produce much better results
3. **Memory Usage**: Advanced processing requires more RAM
4. **GPU Acceleration**: Recommended for optimal performance

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

- All original endpoints remain functional
- Original algorithms still available
- Gradual migration path to advanced features
- Quality comparison available for both versions

## üìã Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The new requirements include:
- `torch` and `torchvision` for AI models

## üéØ Recommendations

1. **For Production**: Use advanced endpoints for best quality
2. **For Speed**: Use basic endpoints for faster processing
3. **For Testing**: Compare both versions to see quality differences
4. **For Large Images**: Consider GPU acceleration for advanced processing

## üîç Quality Testing

Test the improvements by:
1. Processing the same image with basic and advanced endpoints
2. Comparing processing times and quality
3. Checking edge accuracy in background removal
4. Evaluating upscaling detail preservation
5. Assessing object removal seamlessness

The advanced algorithms provide significantly better results at the cost of increased processing time, making them ideal for high-quality image processing applications.
